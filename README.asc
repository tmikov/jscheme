== Java Scheme

+Java Scheme+ is a simple implementation of the Scheme language in Java. It is
intended for embedding but can also be used as a standalone application.

== Usage

A precompiled binary distribution isn't available yet. You need JDK 1.6 and Apache Ant
to build it.

After getting the source, change into the root project directory and build it by running
+ant+ without any parameters.

On success the build will produce +scheme.jar+. It can be
ran simply with +java -jar scheme.jar+.

== License

All code is licensed under GPL v3. See COPYING.
